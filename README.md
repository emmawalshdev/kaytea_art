The Kaytea Art ecommerce website was designed, built, and deployed by Emma Harte. This project completes her Diploma in Software Development, undertaken through the Code Institute. 

This website was built for Katie Harte, a wildlife and animal artist based in West Cork, Ireland.  Through the new Art store, Katie aims to connect with her clients, share her story, and offer her wonderful artwork and commission service. 

Previously, Katie has marketed her work through Etsy and social media.  In the future, the Art store aims to become Katie's primary sales channel. This is a long-term project, with many new exciting features planned for the future.

* People looking for unique art at an affordable price.
* People looking for unique gift ideas.


### User Stories

#### Visitor Stories:
**As a visitor of the website I expect/want/need:**

**Browsing**
1. To be able to browse the website easily without feeling confused or overwhelmed. It should have an easy-to-follow layout on all device sizes.
2. To be able to search for products by text, so that I can find something specific.
3. To browse original artwork and prints, as these are the main categories of an art shop which I would expect to see. 
4. To be able to filter by price within category pages so that I can find a product to suit my budget.
5. To see the image, media used, and canvas size of each product. This information is vital to me.
6. To be able to read product reviews. This helps me to decide on the quality and level of service delivered by the company.
7. To request a quote for a pet commission so that I can decide myself whether this is something I would like to purchase.
8. To receive feedback after I interact with the website so that I am aware if the interaction has or has not been a success.
9. To learn more about the artist and the process behind the creations. As a supporter of small usinesses, I like to feel a connection to the business owner.

**Shopping**
1. To be able to navigate to my shopping cart easily so that I can quickly checkout.
2. To be able to add, edit or delete items or item quantities from my shopping cart so that I can easily modify my choices.
3. To know that the stock levels on products are accurate so that I know shipping delays won't occur. 
4. To receive an email after I submit an order so that I am aware the interaction had been a success.
5. My shipping details should autofill if I am logged in so that I can quickly checkout.

**Customer care**
1. To be able to set up an account, so that I can log in on return, and view my data.
2. To be able to contact the shop owner easily in case I have a question related to my order.
3. To see a summary of my order after I make a purchase so that I can review the details.
4. To see a list of my order history so that I can check up on my recent activity. 
5. To be able to update my account details in case a change is required.
6. To be able to connect to the company owner on social media channels so that I can keep up-to-date. 


#### Business Stories:

**As a superuser of the website I expect/want/need:**

**General**
1. Build a beautiful, easy-to-use, trustworthy website so that I can build brand awareness and sell artwork.
2. To be able to view customer/order/product data so that I easily pull up information if required. 

**Website admin**
1. To be able to add/edit and delete products on the website so that I can keep the information up-to-date.
2. To be able to add/edit and delete blog content on the website so that I can keep the page fresh.

**Online shop admin**

### Wireframes
All wireframes were created using the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
These layouts were created in collaboration with Katie Harte and following research on the five planes of UX\
\
<strong>
Please note, the final website layout contains slight variations to the original wireframes.
Each of the following files contains wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Design

#### Color Scheme

![Color Palette](https://i.ibb.co/HNzkKYt/Color-Palette.png) 
  - #D4D3FF (Lavender Blue)
  - #FFCD69 (Maize Crayolla)
  - #2AA6B3 (Pacific Blue)
  - #F9CFE4 (Mini Pink)
  - #0095FF (Dodger Blue)

 Katie wanted to achieve a playful, colorful website. The above color palette was chosen to create this, with the intention of using a lot of whitespace to prevent noise.


#### Typography

- All fonts used in this project derive from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Fonts used include:
  - ['Sniglet'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sniglet?query=sniglet) with a fallback of cursive, is used for h1 - h6.
  - ['Roboto'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) with a fallback of sans-serif, is used and all other body text.

  ![404 page](https://i.ibb.co/1sWTkZN/404page.jpg)

#### Home Page

  * Comment out the default DATABASES configuration and add the following:

    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
    }
    ```
  * Set up the database through the terminal by typing:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

  * Replace the DATABASES configuration with the following:

      ```
      if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
          DATABASES = {
              "default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
          }
      else:
          DATABASES = {
              'default': {
                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                  'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
              }
          }
      ```

3. Deploy the site
